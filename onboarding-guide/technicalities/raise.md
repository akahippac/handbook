# Discussing Hourly Rates

## Introduction

The goal of this explanation is to help make the rate raise conversation both straightforward and fair. Raises should be predictable and balanced to reflect the effort and growth that you’ve achieved since the last raise, giving you a clear path to achieve your financial goals.

## How does it work?

Rates can be discussed whenever, but we suggest between 12 and 24 months is ideal.

You should initiate a rate discussion with your team's account manager \(on X-Team’s side\) at a time that reflects a significant milestone in growth. This may coincide with an anniversary, the beginning/end of a project, or a major Unleash milestone.

When discussing a new rate, we’ll want to understand what your long-term financial goals are. We want to be able to set a path for the next raise and ensure that our partner contracts can support your new rate.

Prior to agreeing on a raise, your account manager will generally consult your client, your team, and any other relevant people. A new rate will be effective at a date agreed upon, either an upcoming pay cycle or the commencement of a new project.

## What we look for

When we consider rate rises, development capabilities are only one factor.

A true X-Teamer contributes to the success of their community, our partners, and X-Team.

These are the actions we expect to have seen from any X-Teamer looking for a rate raise:

### Community

**The community is yours to mold.**

X-Teamers strive to make X-Team a better company which works with amazing partners, hires new X-Teamers, and improves the lives and skills of our peers.

A true X-Teamer is an ambassador for X-Team around the clock, constantly looking for improvements that benefit us all.

X-Teamers are also constantly looking for ways to share their knowledge, give back to others, and improve their surroundings.

Examples:

* Staying active
  * Active contributor on Slack
  * Starting community initiatives
  * Unleashing/growth as a developer
  * Open source contributions
* Supporting X-Team’s future
  * Developer/client referrals
  * Supporting community events
* Sharing knowledge
  * Mentoring other X-Teamers
  * Writing X-Team blog posts
  * Conference/meetup talks
  * Publishing X-Crash Courses

### Partners

X-Teamers are unstoppable as they go above and beyond to help our partners succeed. While we love to \#shipit, it’s also important to understand the role an X-Teamer plays in building and supporting a great team.
