# X-Team CV Entry

We understand that you would like to showcase what you're doing to the world. Judging by partner feedback, you're excited about your work, and we love that. Even so, when you're putting your work on your CV or LinkedIn, please, keep the following in mind:

* Under employer, **always put down X-Team**. As you will see in the sample template below, it's perfectly fine to mention you're working on a project with the partner, but putting them down as the employer could land both you and X-Team in trouble.
* Both due to NDAs and general security concerns, **please do not specify the exact stacks and/or projects you're working on**. Seeing as you're seniors, giving a more high-level overview should be more than sufficient.

And always remember - we love having you here. But in the hopefully unlikely event that you at some point decide that you'd be happier elsewhere, you can rest assured that you will receive a reference from us, which will dispell any potential doubts anyone might have about your abilities, without exposing both you and us to unnecessary risk.

Sample Template:
