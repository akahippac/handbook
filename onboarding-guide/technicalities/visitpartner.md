# Visiting Partners

We often receive questions about our policy on people visiting the teams they work with every day. We put our heads together and came up with very simple guidelines:

If the partner requests your on-site presence, you have to let your Account Manager (probably Jake, Brad, or Luke) know, not only because you should generally keep them in the loop about anything partner-related but also because they may be able to get you a sweet "travel package".

If your visit, however, is to be unofficial, outside of the partner's premises, and work-free, by all means, go grab a few beers with the team and hang out!
