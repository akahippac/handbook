# Internal Projects

## Introduction

There are two scenarios where you might contribute to X-Team's internal projects:

1. You have just come off of a partner team and we are still looking for your next team.
2. You have been hired before joining a partner team.

In both cases, the whether you get assigned to internal and for how long will be determined by the core team.

We have a variety of internal projects, all of which are critical to the success of X-Team. These are the platforms that drive the core functions of our business and ensure that X-Teamers get to work on great teams and that the community experience is the best it can be.

This guide will help explain the expectations we have around our internal projects.

## Expectations

1. As these internal projects are the lifeblood of X-Team, they should be treated the same as any project you work on. Ensure you maintain your good habits and strong discipline and remind yourself that your performance will ensure that we remain a sustainable company and community.
2. Work on internal projects is full-time \(40 hrs/week\) unless you have an explicit arrangement with our Cavalry Manager before joining the project.
3. The same high coding standards that you would adhere to with a partner team is expected.
4. Communicate actively, join planning sessions, and keep your team up to date on a daily basis via a personal journal like any great developer would.
5. Follow the dev flow that exists on any project and ensure the actions you take conform to our existing standards and methodologies.
6. If you are not performing up to X-Team's standards and expectations \(see above\) after multiple Sprints and have received performance feedback following same without improvement, you will be removed from the project and are less likely to be considered for future opportunities with X-Team.
7. We know that the vast majority of X-Teamers know most, if not all of the above, and work in line with these expectations by nature, but it must be documented and adhered to for everyone and to address any uncertainties. We appreciate all of your work to-date and hope you enjoy the work on our internal projects!

## Vacation Policy

The same vacation policy applies to internal projects as it does to partner projects. Talk to your team, talk to your project manager, and if they say it's fine, put in a [Vacation Request](https://docs.google.com/a/x-team.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduKMlEZMxMLkbmMMszpLqHdOleFct4n337Alm7AMs29MvDZQ/viewform) in XHQ and add it to the gCal shown to you during Internal Project Onboarding with the PM, Gosia.
