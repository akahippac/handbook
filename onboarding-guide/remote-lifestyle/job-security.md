# Job Security

In X-Team, we're all contractors. If this is the first time you're not working as a regular employee with all the legal protections that status affords you, you may be feeling a bit anxious about the lack of job security you have working as a contractor.

But do not fear. As in many other areas, you'll find that we've got your back as much as we can.

So here's the answer to this doubt, which will, hopefully, put your mind at ease.

## What happens when my engagement comes to an end? Am I out of work?

Three scenarios can happen when a project comes to an end:

1. We'll line up another opportunity for you to move on to after your current project ends. This is actually the most common scenario and what we'll be aiming for once you join our community.
2. So long as you've: 1.\) committed to learning and growing; 2.\) have kept your skills current throughout your time in X-Team, and 3.\) performed well for past partners, we will continue investing in you and keep you on board for up to 3 months until we have a new opportunity for you. We have internal projects that are critical to the success of X-Team that we'd love to have you contribute to in the interim.
3. Sometimes, if rarely, negative outcomes do happen. If your skillset no longer aligns with what companies are looking for on their teams or if the feedback we receive from your partner show serious warning signs, we'll have to part ways. This isn't as common in X-Team, as we work hard to support you through every step with your partner experience. We also motivate you to always be learning and growing so that your skills will always remain marketable and can be placed in future roles.
