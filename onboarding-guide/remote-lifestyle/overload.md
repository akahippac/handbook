# Overload

Despite both your and our best efforts to prevent this from happening, real life can sometimes become simply too overwhelming. While we've had encouragingly few cases of burnout over the years, occasionally, it does occur. In such cases, Rest & Relaxation can be a great remedy. Some parts thereof are already covered by utilizing your Unleash budget toward Health & Wellbeing.

If just relaxing with a beverage of your choice on a beach doesn't suffice, however, we recommend you check out [BetterHelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/). It fits perfectly with our remote philosophy. You can talk to the therapist asynchronously via text or set up a live \(video\) call. The therapists are certified professionals, and you get assigned a therapist that specializes in what bothers you.

Of course, you can reimburse the therapy from your $2,500/year Unleash budget.

We hope this helps!
