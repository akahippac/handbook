# Internal Projects

## Introduction

There are two scenarios where you might contribute to X-Team's internal projects:

1. You have just come off of a partner team and we are still looking for your next team.
2. You have been hired before joining a partner team.

We have a variety of internal projects, all of which are critical to the success of X-Team. These are the platforms that drive the core functions of our business and ensure that X-Teamers get to work on great teams and that the community experience is the best it can be.

This guide will help explain the expectations we have around our internal projects.

## Expectations

1. Internal projects should be treated the same as any project you work on. Treating it with less respect purely because it's "internal" is only building poor habits and discipline for yourself. Remember that these projects are the lifeblood of X-Team and what ensure that we remain a sustainable company and community.

2. You will work full-time on internal projects unless you have an explicit arrangement with our Cavalry Manager before joining the project.

3. You are expected to maintain the same high coding standards that you would adhere to with a partner team.  

4. We expect you to communicate actively, join planning sessions, and keep your team up to date on a daily basis like any great developer would.  

5. If you ever need to take time off, please inform the project's team lead or project manager.
