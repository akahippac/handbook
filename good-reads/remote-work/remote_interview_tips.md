# Remote Interviews — Tips for Your Upcoming Interview

by Ryan Chartrand

## Show interest and enthusiasm

People want to work with developers who are excited to work on new challenges.

## Ask questions about their project

* People want to work with developers who are excited to work on new challenges.
* Use this opportunity to understand not just what they’re asking for, but why they’re asking for it.

## Your microphone/webcam is your office/suit

* Having a quality external microphone and headphones will make it easy to hear your call without echoes and also allow you to type if needed.
* Make sure your internet connection is working & microphone levels are good. Ask for feedback from a friend or a fellow X-Teamer! \(Can’t stress enough!\)
* Be 5 minutes early to double check everything is working.

## Talk about past experiences

* If you have worked on something similar in the past, look for a good opportunity to mention it
* Talk about your experience with testing.
* Make a list of times when you optimized performance or overcame a big challenge.

## Be ready to talk about your career goals

* You don’t need huge, revolutionary goals — just focus on the things you want to keep learning and growing in.

## Focus on your development strengths

* You don’t need to talk about everything you’ve ever worked with; just focus on what your strengths are today relevant to the opportunity.
